a) If you remove the "using namespace std;" as instructed, "std" namespace will need to be stated explicitly for C++ standard library components like "cin", "string", and "couts". Failure to do so will lead to compliation errors. To prevent these errors, we use "std::" preceeding standard library components, such as std::string in the code, as shown in the 'modified' code.

b) The compiler will not be able to find a method within the Critter class if the "Critter::" prefix is removed from a method declaration in the "Critter.cpp" file. The compiler is unable to know what "setName" method we are referencing or the "name" member variable being referenced. Retaining the "Critter::" prefix before the method declarations to denote their relationship with the Critter class is the solution to this problem. Generally it is used as a guide for the compiler to know what you are exactly referring to. This too can be seen in the 'modified' code.
